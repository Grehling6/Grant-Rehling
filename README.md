This repository is an example of some of the work I have done with Mizzou Baseball. The file titled JeffDashboard.R is a R Shiny app that I created that allowed players and coaches to view umpire data for upcoming games. The next file pertaining Contact Depth is code generating simple plots that chart the contact depth of some of the team's swings. This data is taken from Trackman game files and manipulated to create plots that coaches and players can utilize for a variety of tasks. Lastly, the Mizzou Baseball Draft Report file is a report I compiled analyzing MLB Draft data since 2013. I have included analysis on the trends and my own thoughts on what the data revealed. I have experience with R, SQL, Excel and Excel VBA.
